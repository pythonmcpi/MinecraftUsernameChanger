# MinecraftUsernameChanger
Doesn't really change your username, but allows you to play with a separate username in singleplayer and some servers.
## NOTE: I need to check the jsonKey variable's value

## Configuration
You need to change some variables for this program to work.

### Windows (Tested)
Change the variable filepath to your launcher_profiles.json file in the .minecraft directory. By default, your can find this in C:\\Users\\\<user\>\\AppData\\Roaming\\.minecraft\\launcher_profiles.json. Replace <user> with your username.

### Mac & Linux (Untested)
Same as windows, but change the path to /home/\<user\>/.minecraft/launcher_profiles.json. Replace <user> with your username.

## Bugs
